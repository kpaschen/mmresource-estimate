# mmresource-estimate
## Estimating cloud resources and costs: a case study using Mattermost

### Goal
Estimate how much it costs to run Mattermost in AWS.

Document how the costs break down by component (e.g. how much for VMs, network traffic, storage, etc)
and how the costs scale with number of users or amount of traffic.

Also document the tools and techniques used for arriving at resource and cost estimates.
For example: AWS pricing calculator; Resource and cost reporting tools within AWS; doing your own resource estimation and comparing it against the published AWS price list.

If there is time, include at least one resource-intensive plugin, such as Jitsi or BigBlueButton videoconferencing.

Alternatively, extend the cost analysis to another cloud hoster, such as GCP.
